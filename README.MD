# Pomodoro Timer

A simple pomodoro web application created using Html, CSS & Javascript.

## Features

- Active Work Timer: Track focused work time.

- Break Timer: Automatically activates when work time ends.

- Reset Button: Allows you to reset the timer at any time.

This project is built on top of an earlier version created by youtuber "ek.developer". I have enhanced the app by incorporating robust error handling, cleaner and more formatted code, and implementing the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) methodology.

Feel free to check out the code, and Iâ€™m open to suggestions or tips as I continue to up-skill myself.
